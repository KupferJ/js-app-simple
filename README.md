A client-sided pod√©dex application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which can communicate with an external API(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=151).
The application fetches elements from the API and displays them as buttons, which will open a modal to display information about the pokemon.
The project utilizes jQuery, Bootstrap, and has two polyfills attached to it.
